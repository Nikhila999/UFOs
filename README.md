# UFOs

## Overview of Project

In this project, we are creating a HTML web page about UFO sightings. On this web page we are displaying the data analysis gathered by UFO enthusists and Ufologists. We are using javascript to add in the filters to browse the tabular data efficiently.
    
## Results

The webpage we created has an image on top, then an article about the what type of data we have and how we gathered. Below the article we have tabular data and filters next to it.

To perform the search on the tabular data, 
- select the filter and 
- click on the text box next to it and type in. 
- We have provided a default text in the filter to show the expected data format. Please look at the image below with all the filter search options.

- We can apply multiple filters on the data set to analyze the data. Image on the left shows the results when `State`(TX) filter is applied and image on right shows results when `State`(TX) and `Date`(1/08/2010) are applied .

## Summary
### Drawback:
One major drawback of this webpage is that we do not know what values the filter accept until we look at the data. For example, the shapes column has values as 'others' and 'undefined' along with circle, triangle. So this could be confusing for people browsing the webpage for the first time.
 
### Further Deveolpment:
To provide more detailed analysis to users, we could make following changes,

- Currently we have data for one country only (US), we could add the data for other countries.
    
- Another recomendation to make the web page more user friendly is to provide the accepted filter inputs in a dropdown for users to select from rather than typing. This provides the insight about the data at a glance and slo avoids spelling mistakes.
